# Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_SVR
____________________________________

In this project, we use support vetcor regression to predict the stock price.                                  

Procedure:                                                                   
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found.                                                        
=> Collect dataset of stock price , it has only one input(item) and one output(price).                                                
=> Load dataset and summarize detials such as number of rows and columns.                                                                
=> Segregate the independant and dependant values using iloc function to evaluate the model.                                                       
=> Test and train dataset using train_test_split.                                                                                             
=> Use Support Vector regression algorithm , where new points are added in the space gap , to class points based on which gap it lies.                      
=> Training model using SVR.                                                                                                   
=> Prediction and validation using r2_score, mean_square_error.
